##Trailer download tool for Kodi media collections

Downloas trailers for movies, either from a URL defined in the .nfo file, or by searching Youtube and taking the first result.

###Requirements:

A folder structure like this:

    Top-level movie folder
    |> The Hitchhiker's gude to the galaxy (2001)
    |> Alamar (2009)
    |> A.I. Artificial Intelligence (2001)
      |> A.I. Artificial Intelligence (2001) [720p].mp4
      |> A.I. Artificial Intelligence (2001) [720p].nfo
      
The .nfo file must be a standard XML file (in my case, generated by [MediaElch](https://www.kvibes.de/en/mediaelch/)), containing _at least_ the movie title, although the year and a trailer URl will also be used if found.

* `youtube-dl` installed and in your PATH

* Java (1.8+)

Should work on Windows / Mac / Linux, but I've only tested on Linux.

Download the .jar file from the releases section, and run it:

    java -jar KodiTralierDownloader.jar --input-directory "/path/to/top-level-directory/"
    
 It will (should...) do the rest.

  I recommend not looking at the code, it's a mess and will hurt your eyes (and brain).
 
 You're welcome to report bugs, but it's unlikely I'll fix them, since this is an "I wrote this in an afternoon because I didn't find another way to do it, and it works for me" kind of project.
